### Abstract Factory Design Pattern Notes:

#### Definition:

The Abstract Factory Pattern is a **creational design pattern** that provides an interface to create families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

---

### Key Points:

1. **Purpose**:

   - Encapsulates object creation logic for families of related objects.
   - Promotes consistency across object families.

2. **When to Use**:

   - When you need to create objects that are related or dependent on each other.
   - When the system needs to be independent of the way its objects are created.

3. **Benefits**:

   - **Encapsulation of Object Creation**: Clients are decoupled from the concrete classes.
   - **Consistency**: Ensures that related objects are compatible.
   - **Extensibility**: Easy to introduce new families of products without modifying existing code.

4. **Drawbacks**:
   - Can increase complexity due to the addition of multiple classes and interfaces.
   - Difficult to modify existing families without altering the abstract factory interface.

### Common Interview Questions:

1. **What is the Abstract Factory Pattern used for?**

   - To create families of related objects without tying the client to specific classes.

2. **How does it differ from the Factory Method?**

   - Factory Method creates one type of object, while Abstract Factory creates families of related objects.

3. **Real-world examples?**

   - **UI Toolkits**: Creating GUI components (e.g., buttons, checkboxes) that vary by OS (Windows, macOS).
   - **Database Access**: Abstracting creation of database connections for different database engines.

4. **Advantages of Abstract Factory?**

   - Provides flexibility to switch between families of products.
   - Promotes consistency within families of related objects.

5. **Challenges?**
   - Adding new product types (not families) can require changes to the factory interface.

### Key Concepts:

1. **Abstract Product**: Interfaces for product families (e.g., `Chair`, `Sofa`).
2. **Concrete Product**: Specific implementations of the products (e.g., `ModernChair`, `VictorianChair`).
3. **Abstract Factory**: Interface for creating products (e.g., `FurnitureFactory`).
4. **Concrete Factory**: Specific factories that produce families of products (e.g., `ModernFurnitureFactory`).
